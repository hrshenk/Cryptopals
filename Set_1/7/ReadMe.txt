base64_to_hex was used to convert the base 64 encoded document available
at http://cryptopals.com/7.txt to hexencoded.txt for compatibility with
the 7 executable.  Source code for base64encoded can be found in the 
challenge 1 folder.  Note, base64_encoded.txt is simply 7.txt renamed 
for compatibility with the base64_to_hex executable.
