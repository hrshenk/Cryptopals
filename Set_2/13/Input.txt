In order to craft a token that will provide the admin role submit a string such as:

"aaaaaaaaaaadmin\x0b\x0b\x0b\x0b\x0b\x0b\x0b\x0b\x0b\x0b\x0b\n"

The first 10 'a' chars in the above string force admin to be placed at the beginning of the second encrypted block.

The \x0b characters will serve as padding in the 'attack' token (I used the Open3 Ruby library to launch

the program and submit non-printable characters to its stdin pipe).

Once the token for this input is received copy and save the second 16 byte block from the token for use later.

Next create another profile for a token with a string such as:

"12345678901234"

Note the string above is 14 chars.  This aligns the token such that the last encrypted block starts with the string "user"

Once the second token is received, simply replace the last block of it with the block saved earlier.

The attack token will decrypt to: email=12345678901234&uid=0&role=admin.
